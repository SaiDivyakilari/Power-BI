## Data Transformation Summary

The data was cleaned and transformed in Power Query using the following steps:
- Removed blank rows and unnecessary columns
- Merged `Date` and `Time` columns
- Changed data types for consistency
- Split columns for roles and programming languages using delimiters
- Replaced null/irrelevant values
- Duplicated and modified salary fields to create average salary metrics
- Created custom columns for analysis (e.g., difficulty level, salary ranges)
